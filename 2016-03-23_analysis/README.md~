# Data Analysis scripts for March 23rd 2016 run

## Description

This repository contains some tools to do excess-power analysis on the first
all stations run from March 23rd, 2016. 

## Prerequisites

We present below the version used for every module imported in this work.

============ ==========
Package      Version

============ ==========

We note that the Scipy v0.19.0 released in early March 2017 is not compatible
with the some of the LIGO modules used when the scripts were written. In
particular, the now deprecated scipy.weave library has been removed. This
library is used by the pycbc package.
